# EMF Refactor
This repository was used during my masterthesis to continue the development of EMF Refactor. 
It is no longer used and therefore made readonly to save the history of changes. 

The development is continued by the Software Design and Quality group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and can be found here:
https://github.com/kit-sdq-emf-refactor-fork.
The repository structure is different there. It is based on the orignal structure used by the EMF Refactor project http://git.eclipse.org/c/refactor/.
